    "description": "As an engineer at Notifai; a company making enterprise enviromental and air quality sensing solutions, For many of our PCB designs we needed a 3D model of the full board to help decide on casing design. For some of the models I had to fully design using the specs on the datasheets(see some in images). For other 3D models of components, they are available online or from the manufacturer, but some weren't exact to the model or specification. I used solidworks to make necessary design, placement, and colour changes.",

Blender was used to add the logo to an existing gimble design, and the cup shown and another were made custom using Solidworks. The logo was converted from Adobe Illustrator, into the respective modelling software",

Aside from programming the PLC I made some concept designs that I felt could improve the existing machine for the purpose it was being used for. This was a clamp to catch the fibres when they reached the break when being unspooled to prevent it from whipping around.",
