    "description": "At my work in Wuhan, China at a company called Yangtze Fibre Optics and Cable Co. I worked on a PLC and HMI for a machine that was used for moving damaged fibre optic strings from a good spool to one where it could be easily removed. For the PLC this meant using inputs such as detecting the tension between the spools and HMI inputs in the PLC, and outputting to control motor speed linear alignment actuators and more. This was all programmed in ladded logic in Siemens Simatic Step 7",

I worked on a PLC and HMI for a machine that was used for moving damaged fibre optic strings from a good spool to one where it could be easily removed. The HMI(Human Machine Interface) included visualizations of current inputs such as speed from encoders, and what is activated. It also included the ability to easily change many of the operating parameters. The HMI was built completely in Siemens Simatic WinCC",
